## Security Features Implemented

### 1. **JWT Authentication**

- All protected routes require a valid JWT token.
- Tokens are signed with a secret and have a 3-day expiry.
- JWT tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies for enhanced security.
- Session versioning prevents token reuse after logout.

### 2. **Password Hashing**

- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- Passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text.

### 3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via Email OTP**

- On login, after correct password, a 6-digit OTP is sent to the user's email.
- OTP is valid for 5 minutes and must be verified before login is completed.
- JWT is only issued after successful OTP verification.

### 4. **Role-Based Access Control**

- Admin and user roles are enforced both in backend and frontend.
- Admin-only routes are protected by middleware.
- React Context API used for user state management instead of localStorage.

### 5. **Enhanced Input Validation & Sanitization**

- Frontend uses Yup for comprehensive form validation with strong password requirements.
- Backend implements comprehensive input sanitization using XSS protection.
- Email and phone number formats are strictly validated.
- All MongoDB ObjectIds are validated before DB queries to prevent NoSQL injection.
- Input sanitization middleware applied to all user inputs.
- Strong password policy: minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character requirements.

### 6. **Enhanced File Upload Security**

- Only image files are accepted for uploads (avatars, book images).
- Strict MIME type validation prevents file type spoofing.
- File size limits are enforced (5MB for book images, 5MB for avatars).
- Uploaded files are renamed with random names to prevent collisions.
- Rate limiting on file uploads (10 uploads per 15 minutes per IP).

### 7. **Password Reset Security**

- Password reset tokens are JWTs with a 15-minute expiry.
- Tokens are stored in the database and invalidated after use.

### 8. **CORS Protection**

- CORS is enabled and restricted to specific frontend origins.

### 9. **Error Handling**

- Generic error messages are returned to avoid leaking sensitive information.

### 10. **Request Size Limiting**

- The request body size is limited to 10MB.

### 11. **Rate Limiting**

- Sensitive authentication routes (login, OTP, password reset) are rate-limited to prevent brute-force attacks.

### 12. **XSS Protection**

- All user input is sanitized using `xss-clean` middleware.

### 13. **Advanced Content Security Policy (CSP)**

- Strict CSP is enforced using helmet to restrict sources of scripts, styles, images, etc.
- CSP violation reporting is enabled.

### 14. **HTTP Security Headers**

- `helmet` is used to set headers for clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and other common web vulnerabilities.

### 15. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**

- The backend sets the Strict-Transport-Security header (HSTS) in production.
- Forces browsers to use HTTPS for all requests, preventing protocol downgrade and cookie hijacking attacks.

### 16. **HTTP Request Logging**

- All HTTP requests are logged using `morgan` and stored with `winston` in `logs/combined.log` and `logs/error.log`.

### 17. **Environment Variable Validation**

- The app will not start if any required environment variable is missing, preventing insecure or misconfigured deployments.

### 18. **Account Lockout After Multiple Failed Logins**

- After 5 failed login attempts, the user account is locked for 15 minutes.
- Prevents brute-force attacks by making repeated login attempts ineffective.
- User is notified of lockout status and remaining lockout time.

### 19. **Audit Logging of Sensitive Actions**

- All sensitive actions (login, logout, profile update, failed login) are logged to a dedicated audit log collection in the database.
- Each log entry includes user ID, action, resource, IP address, user agent, and timestamp.
- Supports auditing, troubleshooting, and security reviews.

### 20. **Email Notifications for Security Events**

- Users receive email notifications for important security events:
  - Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
  - Password change
- Helps users detect suspicious activity and respond quickly to potential threats.

### 21. **Logout from All Devices (Session Invalidation)**

- Users can log out from all devices/sessions with a single action.
- All existing JWTs are invalidated by incrementing a session version in the database.
- Prevents session hijacking and allows users to secure their account if a device is lost or compromised.

### 22. **Enhanced Input Sanitization with DOMPurify (Frontend)**

- All user-generated HTML content rendered in the frontend is sanitized using DOMPurify.
- Comprehensive text sanitization for all user inputs.
- Prevents XSS attacks by ensuring only safe HTML is rendered.
- Utility functions for sanitizing both HTML and plain text content.

### 23. **Google OAuth Integration**

- Secure Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow.
- Google Identity Services integration for seamless login.
- Automatic user account creation for new Google users.
- Secure token verification on backend.

### 24. **Real-time Messaging System**

- WebSocket-based real-time messaging between users.
- Secure socket authentication and message validation.
- Message history and conversation management.
- Real-time notifications for new messages.

### 25. **Enhanced State Management**

- Zustand for lightweight state management.
- React Context API for user authentication state.
- Secure token storage in httpOnly cookies.
- Automatic token refresh and session management.

### 26. **Characters Typing CAPTCHA Integration**

- Simple character-based CAPTCHA on registration.
- Users must type a random 5-character string exactly.
- Client-side and server-side verification of CAPTCHA answers.
- Prevents automated bot registrations and credential stuffing attacks.
- User-friendly and accessible.

### 27. **Security Monitoring Dashboard** (NEW)

- **Real-time Security Metrics**: Monitor failed logins, suspicious activities, rate limit violations, and locked accounts in real-time.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Track total users, active users, and system activity rates.
- **Security Analytics**: Visualize security event trends, severity distributions, and activity patterns.
- **Suspicious IP Tracking**: Identify and monitor IP addresses with suspicious activity patterns.
- **Comprehensive Audit Logs**: Detailed activity logs with filtering and search capabilities.
- **Export Functionality**: Export security logs in CSV format for external analysis.
- **Alert System**: Visual alerts for critical security metrics with configurable thresholds.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh every 30 seconds to ensure current data.
